# Redaction Policy (Public)

This repo intentionally omits:
- Attack prompts, jailbreak seeds, and fuzzing chains
- Provider credentials, deployment URIs, rate-limit configs
- Eval thresholds, heuristic weights, test keys
- Internal datasets and annotation guidelines

We publish:
- Artifact formats and contracts (`events.jsonl`, `metrics.json`, `report/index.md`)
- High-level risk categories and severity names
- Architecture diagrams, pipeline overview, and ethics commitments

**Rationale:** Protects safety work from misuse while enabling legitimate evaluation and integration. If you need more detail for collaboration, contact the maintainer privately.
